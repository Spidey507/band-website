        <p>Architects are a British metalcore band from Brighton, East Sussex, formed in 2004 by twin brothers Dan and
            Tom Searle. The band now consists of Dan Searle on drums, Alex Dean on bass guitar, Sam Carter on vocals,
            and Adam Christianson and Josh Middleton on guitars. They have been signed to Epitaph Records since 2013.
        </p>
        <p>Strongly influenced by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, the sound of their first three albums was
            coarse, chaotic, and rhythmically complex. In 2011, Architects went in a more melodic post-hardcore
            direction with The Here and Now, alienating some of their fanbase. The following year, they returned
            towards their original style with Daybreaker, establishing a balance of melody and technical harshness while
            introducing more politicised lyrics. With the release of their sixth album Lost Forever // Lost Together
            in 2014, the band achieved lasting popularity and critical acclaim.</p>
        Soon after the release of their seventh album All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us in 2016, guitarist and principal
        songwriter Tom Searle died after three years of living with skin cancer. In September 2017, the band
        released the single "Doomsday"–the last song he was working on before his death–and announced Middleton as
        their new lead guitarist. The single is featured on Holy Hell, their first album recorded without Tom
        Searle, which was released in November 2018.</p>
